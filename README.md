1. Create an account on Github (using your personal email)
1. Fork this repo and clone it locally (Google it if you don't know how. I suggest using a tool like SourceTree)
1. In the cloned repo on your local HD:
	- You will create a directory with the Kaggle Project name in this repo.
	- You will update the readme.md file to include information about the competition (similar to the landing page for the project)
	- Create a jupyter python notebook with your work in DSS and export it to your top level project directory
	- Create a DSS directory and place your project ZIP file in that directory.
	- A report explaining what you did, why you did it, and what you concluded.
1. When your work is done, you will create a pull (merge) request
